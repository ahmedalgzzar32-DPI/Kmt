A Documentary Film

## 🎥 About the Project  
*Kmt* is a documentary film that explores one of the most common yet often unnoticed challenges in modern work culture — *burnout*.  

Burnout isn’t just about being tired or bored with your job.  
It’s a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion that makes you lose your passion, energy, and sense of accomplishment.  

It starts quietly — a little pressure, too many responsibilities, lack of appreciation —  
and before you know it, you’re struggling to keep the same enthusiasm you once had.  

Through real stories and research, this project sheds light on how burnout develops, how it affects individuals and society, and how we can recognize and overcome it.

## 🎯 Objectives  
Our goal is to raise awareness about the causes, signs, and impact of burnout,  
and to encourage a healthier balance between *work and rest, **ambition and peace*.
